We have created two functions that can be used in PHP, Laravel, and other MVC frameworks with some modifications.

The first function will read all tokens, set a variable using a loop, and prepare it to pass to the CURL.

Another function is created to read the credentials from a JSON file, get the credentials, and use them as required.

## Please note: Ensure the JSON file is protected from public access.
